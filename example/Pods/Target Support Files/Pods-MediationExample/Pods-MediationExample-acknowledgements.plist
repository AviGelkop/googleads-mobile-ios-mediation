      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

YOUR USE OF THE FYBER SDK IS SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT. BY CLICKING THE “I AGREE” BUTTON OR BY USING ANY PART OF THE FYBER SDK, YOU AGREE (ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF AND/OR YOUR COMPANY) TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, WHICH THEN COMMENCES WITH EFFECT AS A LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND THE FYBER GROUP. IF YOU DO NOT OR CANNOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU MUST NOT DOWNLOAD OR USE THE FYBER SDK.

IMPORTANT NOTE: This license is primarily applicable to several proprietary components, owned by more than one entity of the Fyber Group, which are not open sourced. If applicable, the Open Source Software license shall take precedence over the rights and restrictions granted in this Agreement, but solely with respect to such Open Source Software.

1. Definitions.

1.1 “Open Source Software” includes, without limitation, a software license that requires as a condition of use, modification, and/or distribution of such software that such software or other software incorporated into, derived from or distributed with such software be (a) disclosed or distributed in source code form; (b) be licensed for the purpose of making derivative works; or (c) be redistributable at no charge.

1.2 “Fyber Group” means any entity that, directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with Fyber N.V to this Agreement, but only for so long as such control exists, and where “control” shall mean ownership of more than 50% of the stock or other equity interests entitled to vote for the election of directors or an equivalent governing body.

1.3 “Fyber SDK” includes the documentation, software, both source code and object code, sample applications, emulator, tools, libraries, APIs, data, and materials provided by the Fyber Group to You for use in connection with Your mobile application, and includes any updates that may be provided by the Fyber Group.

1.4 “Fyber Services” by integrating the Fyber SDK with your mobile application, you will be able to use the Fyber services (subject to entering into a commercial agreement with Fyber pertaining to such services), which will enable you to sell your mobile application ad space inventory to advertisers programmatically.

1.5 “You” (or “Your”) shall mean an individual or legal entity exercising permissions granted by this License.

2. License Grant.

2.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Fyber Group hereby grants to You a royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable and worldwide license to download and use the SDK for the sole purpose of connecting to and using the Fyber Services.

3. Restrictions.

3.1 Except for the limited license granted to You herein, You agree that all right, title and interest in and to the Fyber SDK including the concepts and technology inherent in them, trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights, are, and at all times shall remain, the sole and exclusive property of the Fyber Group. Except to the extent permitted under this Agreement or by applicable law, You shall not (i) modify, reverse engineer or disassemble any portion of the Fyber SDK; (ii) lease, rent, copy, redistribute or sublicense the Fyber SDK to third party; or (iii) remove, efface or obscure any copyright notices, logos or other proprietary notices or legends included in the FYBER SDK. You may not use any component part of the Fyber SDK in any way independent from the Fyber SDK. You may not load or install any of the Fyber SDK onto any other devices, except on Your mobile application.

3.2 The Fyber Group may extend, enhance, or otherwise modify the Fyber SDK at any time without notice. If updates are made available by the Fyber Group, the terms of this Agreement will govern such updates, unless the update is accompanied by a separate license, in which case the terms of that license will govern. The Fyber Group is not obligated to provide any maintenance, technical or other support for the Fyber SDK. You acknowledge that the Fyber Group has no express or implied obligation to announce or make available any updates to the Fyber SDK.

4. Use of the Fyber SDK.

4.1 Your Application(s) must not (i) breach any applicable laws, regulations or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the applicable jurisdictions; (ii) contain any material, component or code which could damage, destroy, unduly burden or unreasonably affect software, firmware, hardware, data, systems, services, or networks; or (iii) disable, hack or otherwise interfere with any authentication, content protection, digital signing, digital rights management, security or verification mechanisms implemented in or by the Fyber Group and/or the Fyber Services.

4.2 Your mobile application(s) must not breach any applicable laws, regulations or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the applicable jurisdictions or disable, unduly burden or unreasonably interfere with software, firmware, hardware, data, systems, services, or networks.

5. Open Source Software.

5.1 You hereby acknowledge that the Fyber SDK may contain Open Source Software. You agree to review any documentation that accompanies the Fyber SDK in order to determine which portions of the Fyber SDK are Open Source Software and are licensed under an Open Source Software license. To the extent any such license requires that the Fyber Group provides You the rights to copy, modify, distribute or otherwise use any Open Source Software that are inconsistent with the limited rights granted to You in this Agreement, then such rights in the applicable Open Source Software license shall take precedence over the rights and restrictions granted in this Agreement, but solely with respect to such Open Source Software.

5.2 You acknowledge that the Open Source Software license is solely between You and the applicable Open Source Software. You shall comply with the terms of all applicable Open Source Software licenses, if any.

6. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

6.1 THE FYBER SDK IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. FYBER DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE USE OF THE FYBER SDK WILL NOT INFRINGE ANY THIRD PARTY’S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. FYBER DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE FYBER SDK IS ERROR FREE AND MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE FYBER SDK, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR AGAINST INFRINGEMENT, OR ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY ARISING OUT OF TRADE USAGE OR OUT OF A COURSE OF DEALING OR COURSE OF PERFORMANCE. NO INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY THE FYBER GROUP OR ITS AGENTS, EMPLOYEES, OR REPRESENTATIVES, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, SHALL CREATE ANY
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY.

6.2 TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE FYBER GROUP BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, OR FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR FOR ANY PECUNIARY DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR GRANT OF LICENSE HEREIN, OR INABILITY TO USE THE FYBER SDK, THE PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT OR OTHER SERVICES, INFORMATION, SOFTWARE, AND RELATED CONTENT THROUGH THE SOFTWARE OR OTHERWISE ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF THE FYBER SDK, OR OTHERWISE UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, HOWEVER CAUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) AND EVEN IF THE FYBER GROUP HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Indemnification.

7.1 You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Fyber Group from any claims, damages, liabilities, losses, costs, suits or expenditures incurred by the Fyber Group, as a result of any infringement or alleged infringement of intellectual property rights of a third party caused by or arising out of, resulting from, or related to failure to comply with the terms of this Agreement, including but not limited to (1) the clauses directed to combining the SDK with Open Source Software, (2) unauthorized use or disclosure of SDK, and (3) use of SDK in combination with software, hardware, systems, or other items not provided by the Fyber Group.

8. Confidentiality.

8.1 You acknowledge and agree that the FYBER SDK was developed at considerable time and expense by the Fyber Group and contains valuable trade secrets and confidential information of the Fyber Group. Accordingly, You agree to maintain the FYBER SDK in confidence and except as expressly provided in Section 2, You (i) will not disclose or provide access thereto to any person, or (ii) use the Fyber SDK for any purpose not expressly authorized hereby, or permit or authorize any other person to do so.

8.2 The restriction herein shall not apply to the extent that such information is in the public domain or hereafter falls into the public domain through no fault of You. Any combination of trade secrets and information of the Fyber Group that forms part of the Fyber SDK shall not be deemed to be public merely because individual parts of the Fyber SDK are in the public domain, unless the combination itself is in the public domain.

9. Term and Termination.

9.1 Term. The term of this Agreement shall commence as of your acceptance of the terms of this Agreement or your use of the Fyber SDK and continue until (a) terminated by either You or the Fyber Group; or (b) termination or expiration of your agreement with the Fyber Group.

9.2 Termination. You may terminate this Agreement simply by ceasing Your use of the Fyber SDK. The Fyber Group may terminate this Agreement (i) at any time for any or no reason upon 14 day’s written notice to you or (ii) immediately upon written notice to You if You have materially breached this Agreement.

9.3 Effect of Termination. Upon termination of this Agreement: (a) all license rights granted in this Agreement will terminate; (b) You shall promptly stop the distribution of the Fyber SDK and destroy all electronic copies of the Fyber SDK and/or return the Fyber SDK to the Fyber Group. The Sections entitled Restrictions, Use of the Fyber SDK, Open Source Software, Disclaimer of Warranty, Indemnification, Confidentiality, Term and Termination and General Legal Terms shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason.

10. General Legal Terms.

10.1 Export Compliance. You are responsible for applying for and obtaining all export and import licenses and/or authorizations related to the Fyber SDK or Applications, including without limitation all such licenses and authorizations required by any and all governmental bodies and/or regulatory agency.

10.2 Assignment. You may not assign the Agreement, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without the Fyber Group’s prior written consent, and any attempt to do so without such consent shall be void.

10.3 Governing Law; Venue. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Israel without regard to any conflict-of-laws rules. Each Party agrees to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Tel-Aviv, Israel. The parties specifically exclude from application to the Agreement, including theses Terms, the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act.

10.4 Amendments and No Waiver. This Agreement may be modified without notice. The failure by the Fyber Group or You to insist upon strict performance of any of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall in no way constitute a waiver of its rights as set forth in this Agreement, at law or in equity, or a waiver of any other provisions or subsequent default by the other party in the performance or compliance with any of the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

10.5 Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the entire agreement of You and the Fyber Group with respect to its subject matter and supersedes all existing agreements and all other oral, written or other communications between the You and the Fyber Group concerning this subject matter.
